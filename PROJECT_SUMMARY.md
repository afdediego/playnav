### Design Patterns
- **Entity-Component System**: Game objects are entities with update/draw methods
- **State Management**: Centralized GameStateManager handles all game logic
- **Hook-based Architecture**: Custom hooks for game loop, input, audio, storage
- **Separation of Concerns**: Engine logic separate from React components
- **Observer Pattern**: Callbacks for state changes (score, lives, level)

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Player
- Movement speed: 100 units/second
- Shoot cooldown: 0.5 seconds
- Invulnerability: 2 seconds after hit
- Initial lives: 3

### Enemies
- 3 types: Squid (30pts), Crab (20pts), Octopus (10pts)
- Formation movement with coordinated drops
- Random shooting with level-based probability
- Speed increases per level and when fewer remain

### Bullets
- Player bullets: 150 units/second upward
- Enemy bullets: 150 units/second downward
- Simple AABB collision detection

### Levels
- Progressive difficulty scaling
- More enemies per level
- Faster movement per level
- Increased shooting frequency
- Speed boost after each drop

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Game Constants (customizable)
```typescript
CANVAS_WIDTH: 320
CANVAS_HEIGHT: 180
TARGET_FPS: 60
PLAYER_SPEED: 100
BULLET_SPEED: 150
BASE_ENEMY_SPEED: 10
BASE_SHOOT_PROBABILITY: 0.0001
INVULNERABLE_TIME: 2
```

### Performance
- Fixed timestep game loop
- Delta time for smooth movement
- Efficient Canvas rendering
- Minimal React re-renders
- RequestAnimationFrame for 60 FPS
